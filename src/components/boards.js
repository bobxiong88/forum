        This board is for the discussion of news, world events, political issues, and other related topics.

        Off-topic and /b/-tier threads will be deleted (and possibly earn you a ban, if you persist). Unless they are quality, well thought out, well written posts, the following are some examples of off-topic and/or /b/-tier threads:

        >Red pill me on X. (with no extra content or input of your own)
        >Are X white?
        >Is X degeneracy?
        >How come X girls love Y guys so much?
        >If X is true, then how come Y? Checkmate Z.

        The variety of threads allowed here are very flexible and we believe in freedom of speech, but we expect a high level of discourse befitting of the board. Attempts to disrupt the board will not be tolerated, nor will calls to disrupt other boards and sites.

        If you want a place to discuss topics not related to news, world events, or politics, please try /bant/ - International/Random,
